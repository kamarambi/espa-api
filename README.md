# espa-api [![build status][0]][1] [![Codecov branch][12]][13]

This is an API for interacting with the ESPA ordering system. 

## User API
The User API is public facing and available for anyone to code and interact with.  
Version 1 provides the minimum functionality necessary to determine available 
products from a list of inputs, place orders, and view order status. There are 
endpoints for providing available projections, resampling methods, and output formats.

All user interactions with API functions must be accompanied by valid credentials. 
Accounts are managed in the [USGS EROS Registration system][10].

The api host is `https://espa.cr.usgs.gov/api`.

### Quick Unix Walk-through

The ESPA ordering system provides an API for users to interact with using
simple HTTP communications through the programming language of their choice.

1. To find what products ESPA can produce for a given Landsat 
acquisition: [/available-products](docs/API-RESOURCES-LIST.md#apiProdsPost)
1. If the acquisition can be processed into a desired product, create a 
processing order request: [/order](docs/API-RESOURCES-LIST.md#apiSubmitOrder)
1. When processing has completed, get the download URL while the output is 
still available: [/item-status](docs/API-RESOURCES-LIST.md#apiItemStats)

For a more detailed list of User API operations, see the [Available Resources List][6]. 

For a language-specific (python) example, please see [an API Demo][11].
